# What Do Consumers Value in a Used Car?
In the given dataset and the question asked, "What do consumers value in a used car?" can be reinterpreted as "What asking price should a used car dealer set for the cars on their lot?"

This interpretation makes more sense from a dealer’s perspective. A bigger question for a dealer would be to determine two key price points:

The purchase price – How much should I pay for a car at an auction?
The asking price – What price should I set when selling the car?
Since the dataset contains only one price column, and it is not explicitly defined as either the purchase price or the asking price, I will focus on answering the latter question.
